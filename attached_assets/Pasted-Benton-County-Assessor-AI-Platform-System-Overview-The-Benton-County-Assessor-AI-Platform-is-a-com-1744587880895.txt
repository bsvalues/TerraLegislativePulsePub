Benton County Assessor AI Platform
System Overview
The Benton County Assessor AI Platform is a comprehensive system designed to transform property assessment operations through the power of artificial intelligence. This platform aims to enhance data quality, streamline workflows, and ensure adherence to Washington State regulations.

Architecture
The platform is built on a multi-agent architecture orchestrated by a Master Control Program (MCP):

Master Control Program (MCP) - Central orchestration system that coordinates all agents
Specialized AI Agents:
Data Validation Agent - Ensures property data integrity against WA standards
Valuation Agent - Calculates property values using multiple approaches
User Interaction Agent - Handles natural language interface for staff
Property Impact Analyzer - Analyzes legislative impact on property assessments
Core Capabilities
Data Validation
The Data Validation Agent performs comprehensive validation of property assessment data according to Washington State Department of Revenue guidelines:

Parcel ID format validation
Address validation
Value range validation
Property classification checks
Data completeness checks
API Endpoint: /api/mcp/property-validate

Property Valuation
The Valuation Agent implements multiple valuation methodologies in accordance with Washington State standards:

Market comparison approach
Cost approach
Income approach (for commercial properties)
API Endpoint: /api/mcp/property-value

Legislative Impact Analysis
The Property Impact Analyzer examines how legislative changes may affect property assessments:

Impact on valuation methodologies
Changes to property tax calculations
Effects on specific property classes
Implementation requirements and timelines
API Endpoint: /api/mcp/property-impact

Natural Language Interface
The User Interaction Agent provides a natural language interface for assessor staff:

Property search
Valuation requests
Data validation
Help and guidance
API Endpoint: /api/mcp/user-query

Technical Implementation
Master Control Program
The MCP serves as the central orchestration system, managing agent registration, message routing, and system monitoring. It provides a unified interface for external systems to access the capabilities of specialized agents.

Message Protocol
All internal communication is standardized using a Model Content Protocol (MCP) that ensures consistent message formats, error handling, and routing between agents.

Integration Points
The system integrates with:

Washington Legislature Bill Tracking
OpenStates API for legislative data
LegiScan API for comprehensive bill information
Benton County document systems

Security and Compliance
The system is designed with security and compliance in mind:

All API endpoints require authentication
Sensitive data is never exposed via APIs
All actions are logged for audit purposes
All functionality complies with Washington State regulations
Getting Started
To use the Benton County Assessor AI Platform:

Ensure database connection is configured
Set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
Start the application server
Access the API endpoints for specific functionality
Example API request to validate property data:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mcp/property-validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "property_data": {
      "parcel_id": "12345678-123",
      "property_address": "123 Example St, Kennewick, WA",
      "assessment_year": 2025,
      "assessed_value": 250000.00,
      "property_class": "Residential"
    }
  }'
