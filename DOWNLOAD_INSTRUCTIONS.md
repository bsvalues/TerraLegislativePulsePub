# Downloading the GitHub Export

Since Replit doesn't have the `zip` command available, here are detailed instructions on how to download the GitHub export files:

## Method 1: Download Files Directly from Replit

1. **Navigate to the Files Tab** in Replit (left sidebar)
2. **Open the `github_export` folder**
3. **Select key files and download them individually**:
   - First, download the basic files: README.md, LICENSE, GITHUB_SETUP.md, .gitignore
   - Then download the Python files in the root directory: main.py, app.py, models.py, config.py, etc.
   - For each folder (agents, mcp, routes, services, static, templates, utils), you'll need to:
     - Navigate into the folder
     - Select all files within it
     - Download them
     - Keep the same folder structure when saving to your local machine

## Method 2: Use Replit's GitHub Integration (Easiest)

If you have a GitHub account connected to Replit:

1. Click on the **Version Control** tab in the left sidebar (Git icon)
2. Click **Create a Git Repository**
3. Enter your GitHub username and repository name
4. Add a description like "Benton County Assessor AI Platform"
5. Select **Public** repository (or Private if you prefer)
6. Before committing, make these adjustments:
   - Rename `dependencies.txt` to `requirements.txt` (create a new file with that content)
   - Add any other specific edits
7. Click **Create Repository & Push**

## Method 3: Copy Files via Command Line

If you have SSH access to a server or another environment:

1. Use `scp` or `rsync` to copy the github_export directory:
   ```bash
   # On your local machine or server with access to Replit
   rsync -av username@replit-hostname:/path/to/github_export/ ~/local-github-export/
   ```

## After Downloading

1. Rename `rename_to_requirements.txt` to `requirements.txt`
2. Follow the steps in GITHUB_SETUP.md to create your GitHub repository
3. Push the contents to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/benton-county-assessor-ai.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Important Notes

- Make sure to maintain the exact folder structure when recreating the project locally
- Check that all files were downloaded properly
- Do not include any sensitive information or API keys when pushing to GitHub
- Ensure environment variables are properly set up in your local development environment
